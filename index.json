As an evolutionary biologist, I\u0026rsquo;m interested in interrogating genetic variation data in order to study the evolutionary forces.\nThe A-Team\u0026rsquo;s efforts in developing methods that provide quality haplotype-phased assemblies, is very important to me, as is our work on methods for analysing genome assembly graphs. Such methods promise richer and more precise analyses than was previously possible with linear references. I think this will enable population genetecists to move beyond analysing SNPs based on re-sequencing against some reference. Instead I hope we will be able to track entire haplotypes through populations \u0026amp; time, in a manner that casts my mind back to the first chapter in Richard Dawkins\u0026rsquo; The Selfish Gene.\nBefore comming to The Earlham Institute, I earned my PhD in Population Genetics from The School of Environmental Sciences at The University of East Anglia, where I was supervised by Professor Cock van Oosterhout. My researched focused on the vital role recombination and hybridisation plays in the adaptive evolution of organisms to dynamic environments. I have studied Diatoms living in seasonally changing ocean regions, and rapidly adapting pathogens such as Oomycetes and Fungi. Before I read for my PhD, I studied for 4 years in Bath for a BSc in Biology, and a MSc in Molecular Microbiology, which is where I fell in love with genomics and evolution.\nA lot of my research requires me to code and I enjoy creating and developing tools. I co-founded and maintain the BioJulia project, which develops and maintains software packages that fulfil many bioinformatics needs. The best software for me isn\u0026rsquo;t only fast and functional, but introduces or presents concepts in a way that bring clarity to scientific work. For me, the tools by Hadley Wickham and the Tidyverse are a great example of that.\nOutside of my scientific work, my hobbies include PC and console gaming, table-top and RPG gaming, and programming. I\u0026rsquo;m also a keen gardener and animal lover: I currently take care of an Axolotl named Joanna, an African Pygmy Hedgehog named Sonic, and a lovely Romanian rescue dog named, Zelda.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"598b63dd58b43bce02403646f240cd3c","permalink":"https://BenJWard.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"author","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m a postdoctoral researcher and software developer in the Assembly \u0026amp; Algorithms (the A-Team) group, led by Bernardo Clavijo at the Earlham Institute in Norwich, England.\nThe A-Team develops assembly tools and pipelines that work with different combinations of data types, including short, long and linked reads, optical maps and Hi-C data.\nIn this multidisciplinary team of data-scientists, engineers, computer programmers and biologists, I bring my experience and perspective as an evolutionary biologist to the team.","tags":null,"title":"Ben J.

Here, we have created chromosome-level assemblies of the _Mus caroli_ and _Mus pahari_ genomes. Together with the _Mus musculus_ and _Rattus norvegicus_ genomes, this set of rodent genomes is similar in divergence times to the _Hominidae_ (human-chimpanzee-gorilla-orangu-tan). By comparing the evolutionary dynamics between the _Muridae_ and _Hominidae_, we identified punctate events of chromosome reshuffling that shaped the ancestral karyotype of _Mus musculus_ and _Mus caroli_ between 3 and 6 million yr ago, but that are absent in the _Hominidae_. _Hominidae_ show between four- and sevenfold lower rates of nucleotide change and feature turnover in both neutral and functional sequences, suggesting an underlying coherence to the _Muridae_ acceleration. Our system of matched, high-quality genome assemblies revealed how specific classes of repeats can play lineage-specific roles in related species. Recent LINE activity has remodeled protein-coding loci to a greater extent across the _Muridae_ than the _Hominidae_, with functional consequences at the species level such as reproductive isolation. Furthermore, we charted a _Muridae_-specific retrotransposon expansion at unprecedented resolution, revealing how a single nucleotide mutation transformed a specific SINE element into an active CTCF binding site carrier specifically in _Mus caroli_, which resulted in thousands of novel, species-specific CTCF binding sites. Our results show that the comparison of matched phylogenetic sets of genomes will be an increasingly powerful strategy for understanding mammalian biology.","tags":null,"title":"Repeat associated mechanisms of genome evolution and function revealed by the Mus caroli and Mus pahari genomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark McMullan","Maryam Rafiqi","Gemy Kaithakottil","Bernardo J Clavijo","Lorelei Bilham","Elizabeth Orton","Lawrence Percival-Alwyn","Ben J Ward","Anne Edwards","Diane GO Saunders"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"473c474286735afe9cff764d1395f231","permalink":"https://BenJWard.github.io/publication/mcmullan-2018-ash/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mcmullan-2018-ash/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The ash dieback invasion of Europe was founded by two genetically divergent individuals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jackie Lighten","Alexander ST Papadopulos","Ryan S Mohammed","Ben J Ward","Ian Paterson","Lyndsey Baillie","Ian R Bradbury","Andrew P Hendry","Paul Bentzen","Cock Van Oosterhout"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"ace762e84273c4a19cfb824157120ab5","permalink":"https://BenJWard.github.io/publication/lighten-2017-evolutionary/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lighten-2017-evolutionary/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Evolutionary genetics of immunological supertypes reveals two faces of the Red Queen","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Mock","Robert P Otillar","Jan Strauss","Mark McMullan","Pirita Paajanen","Jeremy Schmutz","Asaf Salamov","Remo Sanges","Andrew Toseland","Ben J Ward"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"6b4a7060bcd20d2744aebaa7a3ae064a","permalink":"https://BenJWard.github.io/publication/mock-2017-evolutionary/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mock-2017-evolutionary/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Evolutionary genomics of the cold-adapted diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jackie Lighten","Danny Incarnato","Ben J Ward","Cock van Oosterhout","Ian Bradbury","Mark Hanson","Paul Bentzen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"5042568c6626e34e061ac3370d978c35","permalink":"https://BenJWard.github.io/publication/lighten-2016-adaptive/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lighten-2016-adaptive/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Adaptive phenotypic response to climate enabled by epigenetics in a K-strategy species, the fish Leucoraja ocellata (Rajidae)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ben J Ward","Cock Van Oosterhout"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"44f8e401afede6419033d6b283f0614f","permalink":"https://BenJWard.github.io/publication/ward-2016-hybridcheck/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ward-2016-hybridcheck/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"HYBRIDCHECK: software for the rapid detection, visualization and dating of recombinant regions in genome sequence data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark McMullan","Anastasia Gardiner","Kate Bailey","Eric Kemen","Ben J Ward","Volkan Cevik","Alexandre Robert-Seilaniantz","Torsten Schultz-Larsen","Alexi Balmuth","Eric Holub"," others"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"f60b3d026dd7a2dceb5976e14622d93d","permalink":"https://BenJWard.github.io/publication/mcmullan-2015-evidence/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mcmullan-2015-evidence/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Evidence for suppression of immunity as a driver for genomic introgressions and host range expansion in races of Albugo candida, a generalist parasite","type":"publication"}]
